# Geometry
implementation of basic geometric abstractions in c++

This is an implementation of the simplest geometric abstractions on a plane, made in the OOP style, such as: point, line, polygon, ellipse and their special cases (like triangle).
The main functions required for working with these objects are implemented - rotate, reflect, isSimilarTo, Distance and so on.
